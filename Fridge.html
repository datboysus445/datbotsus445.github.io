    <title> THE FRIDGE  </title> 
    
        <h1> the refridgeator that we know of today was invented in 1913 by Fred W. Wolf Jr. 
            who created the first self-contained unit. This was a major step in the evolution of food storage
            as it allowed for a more compact and efficient way to keep food cold. Over the years, fridges have 
            become more advanced with features such as adjustable temperature controls, ice makers, and energy-efficient
            designs. Today, fridges are an essential appliance in most households, helping to keep our food fresh and safe to eat.
